# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Data-Science-Project

In this Project, we are creating a loan approval prediction system using Python. 

âœ… What is a loan prediction system? <br>
A mechanism called the Loan Prediction System allows you to apply for loans and receive notifications when they are approved. By the data provided by the applicant, the system notifies the applicant of the loan's availability. <br><br>

Data Collection - Completeness and correctness of data collection 
Data preparation - cleansing and preparing data for the next steps of model development 
Algorithm Understanding - Knowledge of the algorithm used for model development 
Model Development - Building the model with the right selection of the parameters 
Model Tuning - Improving the model performance by tuning the hyper parameters
Model Evaluation - Testing the model on sufficient sample for correctness 
i)	Final Presentation and QA
ii)	Demonstration of the Working Demo of the system.
